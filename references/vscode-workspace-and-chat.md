# VS Code workspace and Copilot Chat resilience

To keep a stable VS Code workspace identity (which helps Copilot Chat and other workspace-scoped features remember your sessions):

- Open this repository using the workspace file `infrastructure-mode-dns.code-workspace` at the repo root.
- The workspace uses a relative folder path (`.`), so you can rename or move the folder and still open the same workspace identity.
- For important Copilot Chat threads, use the chat Export/Copy actions to save them into this repo (for example, `docs/chat/…md`), and consider pinning key threads.
- If you expected prior chats but don’t see them, confirm you’re on the same VS Code Profile you used previously.
